    A natural language parser is a program that works out the grammatical 
    structure of sentences, for instance, which groups of words go together 
    (as “phrases”) and which words are the subject or object of a verb. 
    Probabilistic parsers use knowledge of language gained from hand-parsed 
    sentences to try to produce the most likely analysis of new sentences. 
    These statistical parsers still make some mistakes, but commonly work 
    rather well. Their development was one of the biggest breakthroughs in 
    natural language processing in the 1990s.
